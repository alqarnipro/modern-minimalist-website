# Modern Minimalist 3-Page Website

## Project Overview

This project is focused on creating a responsive, 3-page website using Tailwind CSS, React, TypeScript, and Next.js. The pages will represent a fictional company and follow modern and minimalist design principles.

## Pages

1. **Home Page**

   - A hero section with a prominent Call To Action (CTA) and client testimonials.
   - A footer with social media links and basic company information.

2. **About Us Page**

   - Company history and mission statement.
   - Team member profiles to showcase the people behind the company.

3. **Services Page**
   - Detailed descriptions of services offered using organized cards or lists.

## Technical Requirements

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling without adding custom classes.
- Avoid using alignment properties like `left` and `right`; use `flex`, `grid`, `start`, `end`, and `gap` properties for layout and alignment.
- Ensure the site is fully **responsive** on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Implement **Page Loading Indicators**, **Skeleton Loading** for data-heavy components, and **Loading Indicators** for all buttons/forms.

## Performance and SEO Optimization

- The website must achieve a **100/100 score** in all categories of **Google PageSpeed Lighthouse**, including:

  - **Performance**
  - **Accessibility**
  - **Best Practices**
  - **SEO**

- Implement performance optimization techniques such as:
  - Image compression
  - Lazy loading for images and videos
  - Caching and minification

## Content

The developer will create content for all pages, representing a fictional company. The content should be engaging, professional, and consistent across all pages.

## Delivery and Timeline

- The project should be completed within **2 days** from the start date.
- The final code should be uploaded to this repository.
- Include a `README.md` file with a detailed explanation of the project structure and instructions on how to run the project locally.

# Modern Minimalist 3-Page Website

## üìã Project Overview

This project aims to develop a modern and minimalist 3-page website using **Tailwind CSS**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js**. The website will be built for a fictional company and will feature a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly across all devices, ensuring an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## üìÑ Pages Included

1. **Home Page**

   - A hero section featuring a prominent Call To Action (CTA) button and client testimonials to engage visitors.
   - A footer displaying social media links and essential company information.

2. **About Us Page**

   - A brief overview of the fictional company‚Äôs history, mission, and vision.
   - Team member profiles to introduce key individuals behind the company, providing a more personal touch.

3. **Services Page**
   - Detailed descriptions of services offered, organized using visually appealing cards or lists for easy readability.

## üîó Importance of a Responsive Navbar

A responsive **Navigation Bar (Navbar)** is a fundamental component of a successful website, as it allows users to navigate easily and intuitively through different sections. A well-implemented Navbar should offer:

- **Smooth Adaptability**: Automatically adjusts its layout based on screen size, such as displaying a hamburger menu on smaller devices.
- **Consistency**: Maintains a unified look and feel across all pages and devices.
- **Accessibility**: Provides accessible navigation options for users of all abilities.
- **Enhanced User Experience (UX)**: Ensures that navigating through the website is straightforward, improving user satisfaction and engagement.

## üñê Role of Gestures in the Navbar

Integrating **gestures** into the Navbar, especially for mobile devices, elevates the usability and interactivity of the website. Gestures such as swiping, tapping, and long-pressing provide a natural and fluid way for users to interact, making the experience more engaging and efficient.

### ‚ú® Key Benefits of Gestures:

1. **Improved Navigation Efficiency**  
   Gestures allow users to open or close the Navbar quickly with a simple swipe, enhancing navigation speed and efficiency.

2. **Increased Accessibility**  
   Gestures offer an alternative way for users with disabilities or those who prefer touch-based navigation to interact with the website effortlessly.

3. **Enhanced User Engagement**  
   Interactive gestures create a more dynamic experience, increasing the likelihood of users staying on the site longer.

4. **Space Optimization**  
   Gestures such as swiping can hide or reveal the Navbar, freeing up valuable screen space on smaller devices for content display.

### üí° Recommended Gestures:

- **Swipe Left/Right**: Open or close the Navbar.
- **Tap**: Activate menu items or open dropdowns.
- **Long Press**: Reveal submenus or display additional navigation options.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

- Utilize **Tailwind CSS** for styling without creating custom CSS classes.
- Avoid using properties like `left` or `right` for alignment. Instead, use modern layout properties such as `flex`, `grid`, `start`, `end`, and `gap`.
- Ensure the Navbar and all other components are fully responsive across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Implement **Page Loading Indicators**, **Skeleton Loading** for content-heavy sections, and **Loading Indicators** for buttons and forms to improve user experience.

## üöÄ Performance and SEO Optimization

To achieve optimal performance and search engine optimization, the website must meet the following criteria:

- **Google PageSpeed Lighthouse Score**: Achieve a perfect score of **100/100** in all categories, including:

  - **Performance**
  - **Accessibility**
  - **Best Practices**
  - **SEO**

- **Optimization Techniques**:
  - Use image compression to reduce load times.
  - Implement lazy loading for images and videos.
  - Enable caching and minification to enhance performance and reduce file sizes.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Content Guidelines

The content for all pages should be created by the developer to represent a fictional company. It must be engaging, professional, and cohesive, reflecting the style and tone of a real-world business.

## üìÖ Project Delivery and Timeline

- The project should be completed within **2 days** from the start date.
- The final code should be uploaded to this repository on GitHub.
